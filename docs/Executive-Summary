## **Company**

**AI Admissions Copilot**
*The operating system for college admissions*

---

## **Problem**

College admissions has become one of the most complex, stressful, and inequitable decision systems facing families globally.

Students navigate thousands of fragmented admissions pages, changing policies, opaque evaluation criteria, and repetitive application portals. High-quality guidance is concentrated among families who can afford **$5,000–$20,000** private consultants, while schools face unsustainable counselor-to-student ratios.

The result is a high-stakes process that is manual, expensive, and fundamentally unscalable.
