# **AI Admissions Copilot — Technical Architecture Overview**

---

## **1. System Overview**

AI Admissions Copilot is built as a **modular, cloud-native AI system** designed to deliver personalized guidance at scale while maintaining accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency.

At a high level, the system consists of five layers:

1. **Client Layer** (Web app + Browser extension)
2. **API & Backend Layer** (Node.js / Express)
3. **AI Agent & Orchestration Layer**
4. **Knowledge & Data Layer**
5. **Infrastructure & Security Layer**

This architecture enables the platform to move beyond “AI advice” into **real workflow execution**.

---

## **2. Client Layer**

### Web Application (React)

* Student dashboard
* Profile builder
* Essay editor
* Application tracker
* Parent summary views

### Browser Extension (Execution Moat)

* Runs directly inside:

  * university admissions websites
  * CommonApp / OUAC / UC Apply portals
* Reads live page content
* Sends contextual data to backend AI agents
* Receives structured instructions:

  * explanations
  * autofill plans
  * warnings & checks

**Why this matters:**
Most competitors stop at advice. The extension allows the AI to **act inside real systems**.

---

## **3. Backend & API Layer**

### Core Backend

* **Node.js + Express**
* Acts as the single orchestration point for:

  * authentication
  * user profiles
  * applications
  * AI agent execution
  * extension communication

### Responsibilities

* Request validation & routing
* Authorization (student / parent / admin)
* Data aggregation for AI agents
* Logging, monitoring, and analytics

The backend is designed as a **modular monolith initially**, with clean boundaries that allow future service separation as scale increases.

---

## **4. AI Agent Architecture (Core Innovation)**

Instead of one generic AI assistant, the system uses **specialized AI agents**, each responsible for a well-defined task.

### Key Agents

* **Strategy Agent**
  Generates personalized admissions plans based on profile, targets, and constraints.

* **Essay Brainstorm & Review Agents**
  Help students identify story angles, structure essays, and refine narratives using rubric-based feedback.

* **Policy Explainer Agent**
  Translates complex admissions and financial aid policies into plain language, contextualized for the student.

* **School Selector Agent**
  Matches students to programs based on competitiveness, preferences, and goals.

* **Application Autofill Agent**
  Generates structured autofill plans for application portals, enabling browser-level execution.

* **Parent Summary Agent**
  Produces concise progress updates for parents.

### Orchestration

A central **Agent Orchestrator** coordinates:

* which agents to call,
* what data to retrieve,
* how to assemble final outputs.

This modular approach allows rapid improvement and experimentation without destabilizing the system.

---

## **5. Knowledge & Data Layer**

### Structured Data (MongoDB)

Stores:

* user profiles
* applications & deadlines
* essays & versions
* school and program metadata
* portal schemas for application systems

### Admissions Knowledge Base (RAG)

* Curated content from:

  * official university admissions pages
  * financial aid policies
  * program-specific requirements
  * internal frameworks and templates
* Content is chunked, embedded, and indexed using **vector search** (MongoDB Atlas Vector Search or equivalent).

**Why RAG matters:**
Admissions policies change frequently. Retrieval ensures:

* up-to-date answers
* reduced hallucinations
* source-controlled responses

---

## **6. Execution Layer (Autofill & Automation)**

The **Application Autofill Agent** bridges AI reasoning and real-world execution:

1. Backend generates a structured autofill plan
2. Browser extension maps plan → live form fields
3. User reviews and confirms
4. Extension executes field population safely

This enables:

* error reduction
* massive time savings
* consistency across applications

This execution capability represents a significant technical and competitive moat.

---

## **7. Infrastructure & Security**

### Infrastructure

* Containerized services (Docker)
* Cloud deployment (AWS / GCP / Azure compatible)
* Scalable horizontally as usage grows

### Security & Privacy

* Role-based access control
* Encrypted data at rest and in transit
* No blind form submission without user confirmation
* Audit logs for agent actions

Student data is treated as **high-sensitivity educational data**, with strict access controls.

---

## **8. Scalability & Reliability**

The system is designed to:

* scale to millions of users
* reuse AI outputs efficiently
* cache frequently requested knowledge
* degrade gracefully under load

As usage increases:

* AI costs scale sub-linearly
* human involvement does not increase proportionally
* margins expand over time

---

## **9. Why This Architecture Wins**

* **Accuracy:** Grounded in real policies, not AI guesses
* **Execution:** Acts inside real systems, not just chat
* **Scalability:** Software-first, not labor-first
* **Defensibility:** Browser automation + domain intelligence
* **Extensibility:** Easily expands to scholarships, internships, grad school

This is not a prompt wrapper.
It is **admissions infrastructure**.
