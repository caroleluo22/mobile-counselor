# **AI Admissions Copilot — Education & Regulatory Q&A Playbook**

---

## **1. “Is this cheating? Are you helping students game the system?”**

**Best answer:**

> No. We do not fabricate credentials or submit anything on a student’s behalf.
> We help students *understand*, *structure*, and *execute* their own applications.

Key points:

* Students provide all factual information
* Essays are guided, not ghostwritten without disclosure
* Autofill requires explicit user review and confirmation
* The platform mirrors what a human consultant already does

**Close with:**

> We level access to guidance — we don’t manipulate outcomes.

---

## **2. “How is this different from essay mills or unethical AI tools?”**

**Best answer:**

> Essay mills replace the student’s voice. We surface it.

Explain:

* We focus on brainstorming, structure, and feedback
* Students remain the author
* We enforce originality and self-authorship guardrails
* We reject fabricating experiences or achievements

**Investor framing:**

> Our incentives are aligned with authenticity and long-term trust.

## **3. “What if universities ban AI-assisted essays?”**

**Best answer:**

> Most universities already assume some level of coaching — human or AI.
> Our system mirrors ethical consulting, not automation of dishonesty.

Key points:

* No institution bans *guidance*
* The platform can adapt:

  * more focus on outlining
  * reflective prompts
  * student-written drafts
* We can provide transparency disclosures if required

**Confidence signal:**

> This is a policy evolution problem, not an existential threat.

**Best answer:**

> No. We do not bypass authentication, scrape private data, or submit applications automatically.

Clarify:

* Autofill is user-initiated
* No credential storage
* No automated submission
* Comparable to password managers or form-assist tools

**Key phrase:**

> The user remains fully in control.

---

## **5. “Could universities block your extension?”**

**Best answer:**

> They could disable autofill, but not interpretation or guidance.

Explain:

* Reading and explaining public web pages cannot be blocked
* Even without autofill, the extension remains valuable
* Autofill is additive, not foundational

**Investor reassurance:**

> Our core value is intelligence, not automation alone.

---

## **6. “What about student data privacy?”**

**Best answer:**

> Student data is treated as high-sensitivity educational data.

Mention:

* Encryption at rest and in transit
* Role-based access control
* No selling of student data

* Audit logs for AI actions

**Optional mention (if asked):**

## **7. “Are there FERPA / GDPR risks?”**

**Best answer:**

> We design conservatively, assuming the highest privacy standard.

Explain:

* Clear consent flows
* Right-to-delete data
* Minimal data retention
* Regional compliance adjustments (EU vs NA)

* Potential for school licensing

**Strong close:**
