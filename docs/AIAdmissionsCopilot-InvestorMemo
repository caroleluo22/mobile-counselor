# **AI Admissions Copilot — Investor Memo**

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

We are building an **AI-powered admissions copilot** that replaces up to **90% of traditional college admissions consulting**, delivering higher consistency, accessibility, and scalability at a fraction of the cost.

College admissions has become one of the most complex, stressful, and unequal decision systems facing families globally. Students navigate thousands of pages of requirements, policies that change yearly, opaque evaluation criteria, and application portals designed for manual repetition. Meanwhile, professional admissions consultants charge **$5,000–$20,000 per student**, remain unscalable, and deliver inconsistent outcomes.

Our platform combines:

* a **domain-specific admissions knowledge engine**,
* a **multi-agent AI reasoning system**, and
* **browser-level automation**

to guide students end-to-end through admissions strategy, essay development, policy interpretation, and application execution.

The result is a **TurboTax-like experience for college admissions** — intelligent, personalized, and automated.

## **2. The Problem**

### Fragmentation & Complexity

Admissions information is scattered across:

* university admissions pages,
* program-specific subpages,
* financial aid sites,
* scholarship portals,
* application platforms (CommonApp, OUAC, UC Apply, etc.).

Even strong students struggle to determine:

* which requirements apply to *them*,
* how policies differ by major or citizenship,
* what actually matters for competitive programs.

### Cost & Inequality

High-quality guidance is concentrated among families who can afford private consultants. This creates systemic inequality in access to elite education.

### Manual, Error-Prone Execution

Applications require repeated data entry, strict formatting limits, and careful deadline tracking. Errors are common and costly.

### Institutional Strain

Schools face counselor-to-student ratios that make individualized guidance impossible.

**In short:** the system is high-stakes, high-cost, and fundamentally broken.

---

## **3. Why Now**

Three forces have converged:

1. **Admissions complexity has reached a breaking point**
   Application volumes and requirements continue to increase year over year.

2. **AI reasoning quality crossed a usable threshold**
   Modern LLMs can synthesize policies, reason over constraints, and generate structured plans.

3. **Browser automation is now viable**
   Extensions can read live websites and execute workflows safely and reliably.

This combination makes a fully automated admissions copilot possible for the first time.

---

## **4. The Solution**

We provide an **AI-first admissions platform** that functions as a full copilot rather than a static advice tool.

### Core Capabilities

* Personalized admissions strategy
* School and program matching
* Essay brainstorming, structuring, and revision
* Plain-language explanation of admissions policies
* Timeline and deadline management
* Automated application form filling
* Parent progress summaries

This replaces the repetitive, informational, and mechanical work traditionally done by consultants while preserving personalization.

## **5. Product & User Experience**

### Student Journey

1. Build a structured student profile
2. Receive a personalized admissions plan
3. Draft essays with guided storytelling
4. Browse admissions websites with live AI explanations
5. Auto-fill application portals with verification

### Browser Extension (Key Differentiator)

The extension allows the AI to:

* read real admissions pages,
* interpret requirements in context,
* explain “what this means for you,”
* auto-fill application portals.

This moves AI from **advice** into **execution**, which competitors lack.

---

## **6. Technology & Defensibility**

### Domain-Specific Intelligence

The platform is grounded in a curated admissions knowledge base:

* official university policies,
* financial aid rules,
* program-specific requirements,
* essay archetypes and narrative frameworks.

This ensures accuracy, freshness, and trust.

### Multi-Agent Architecture

Instead of a single chatbot, we deploy specialized agents:

* Strategy Agent
* Essay Brainstorm & Review Agents
* Policy Explainer Agent
* School Selector Agent
* Application Autofill Agent
* Parent Summary Agent

Agents are orchestrated to solve complex workflows.

### Execution Moat

Browser-level automation enables:

* real-time interpretation,
* application execution,
* workflow completion.

This creates a defensible moat that is difficult to replicate.
